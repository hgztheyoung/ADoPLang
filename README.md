.# ADoPLang
Naively implementing tutorial language from A Discipline of Programming using Racket macros.
The implementation uses some code copied from The Scheme Programming Language(loop macro).The author of that book owns all the rights.
If this project is offending the copyright of the book A Discipline of Programming.I will delete this project.
The code written by me can be used for any purpose without noticing me in advance.
